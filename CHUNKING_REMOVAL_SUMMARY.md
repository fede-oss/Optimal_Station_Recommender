# Chunking Removal Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Simplified OSM Utilities (`src/data/osm_utils_simple.py`)
**Removed features:**
- ❌ `OSMProgressTracker` class for chunk progress tracking
- ❌ `create_grid_chunks()` function 
- ❌ `create_smart_chunks()` function
- ❌ `_is_likely_water_area()` function  
- ❌ `query_osm_chunk()` function
- ❌ Complex chunking logic in `get_osm_geometries()`
- ❌ Multi-threaded chunk processing
- ❌ Chunk progress persistence
- ❌ Water area detection and filtering

**Kept features:**
- ✅ Simple `get_osm_geometries()` function with single queries
- ✅ Basic caching mechanism
- ✅ Retry logic with exponential backoff
- ✅ Error handling and logging
- ✅ Same function signature for compatibility

### 2. Modified OSM Fetcher (`src/data/simple_osm_fetcher.py`)
**Changes:**
- 🔄 Changed import from `data.osm_utils` to `data.osm_utils_simple`
- 🔄 Removed chunking parameter logic - now always uses `use_chunking=False`
- 🔄 Simplified parameter determination for all data types

### 3. Cleaned Up Cache Files
**Removed:**
- 🗑️ All `*_progress.json` files from `cache/osm_data/` directory
- 🗑️ Chunk tracking and resume capability files

## Benefits

### ✅ **Simplified Architecture**
- Single-query approach eliminates chunking complexity
- Reduces code maintenance burden
- Easier to debug and understand

### ✅ **Reliability Improvements** 
- Eliminates Copenhagen-style chunking failures
- No more partial downloads requiring resume
- Cleaner error handling and recovery

### ✅ **Performance**
- No overhead from chunk management
- OSMnx handles large queries automatically 
- Simpler caching mechanism

### ✅ **Compatibility**
- Same function signatures maintained
- Existing pipeline code works unchanged
- All amenity categories still supported

## Testing Results

✅ **London**: Successfully processed with existing cached data  
✅ **Prague**: Successfully fetched 2,545 restaurants using simplified approach  
✅ **Pipeline**: Complete data processing pipeline working correctly  

## Note on OSMnx Automatic Subdivision

The warning message about "subdivide geometry" is from OSMnx itself, which automatically handles large queries by breaking them into manageable pieces. This is different from our removed chunking logic and provides:

- **Automatic optimization** by OSMnx based on query area size
- **No manual chunk management** required
- **Built-in reliability** without custom progress tracking

The simplified approach lets OSMnx handle the complexity while we focus on the core data fetching logic.
