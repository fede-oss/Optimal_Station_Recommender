import pandas as pd

# Load the trained model
model = joblib.load('balanced_rf_h9_20250606_192628.joblib')

# Make predictions

## 📈 Comparison with Baseline

| Aspect | Baseline RF | Enhanced Balanced RF | Winner |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|---------|
| **Station Detection** | 34.4% | **89.8%** | **Enhanced** |
| **False Positive Rate** | 0.8% | 14.4% | Baseline |
| **Training Speed** | 1 hour | **5 minutes** | **Enhanced** |
| **Class Imbalance Handling** | Moderate | **Excellent** | **Enhanced** |
| **Overall Discrimination** | 92.2% ROC-AUC | **95.2% ROC-AUC** | **Enhanced** |

## 🎯 Conclusion

The Enhanced BalancedRandomForest model represents a significant improvement for bike station placement analysis. While it trades precision for recall, the ability to find 90% of actual station opportunities (vs 34% with baseline) makes it the superior choice for comprehensive urban planning and station placement research.

**Recommended for deployment** in exploration and candidate generation phases, followed by business logic filtering for final selection.
